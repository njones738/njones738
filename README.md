I am a data science student at Kennesaw State Univerisity and will be graduating at the end of this year.   

Some of my interests include:
 * Deep Learning    
 * Regression Analysis    
 * Nonparametric Methods    
 * Abstract Mathematics     
 * Numerical Analysis   
 * Data Visualizations

## Current Projects
### ["Does the Pell grant come with a price?"](https://github.com/njones738/Does-the-Pell-grant-come-with-a-price-) - R
* I spatially joined together the Census shapefiles with the CollegeScorecard dataset 
* I spatially analyzed the association between the typical amount of debt an independent student and a dependent student accumulates while attending school.
* VScode was used with R packages that include tidyverse, sf, tidycensus, stringr, magrittr, ggplot, ggh4x, geofacet, and others.

## Previous Projects
### ["Access to Higher Education"](https://github.com/njones738/Access-to-Higher-Education) - R
* I conducted research on the CollegeScorecard dataset through parametric and nonparametric methods.  
* I studied the differences in US schools with either a majority or minority proportion of their student popluation receiving a Pell grant.
* Rstudio was used with tidyverse functions to clean the dataset of missing values and manipulate the data into usable information. Visualizations were created with ggplot methods

### ["Two-Layer Neural Network"](https://github.com/njones738/2L_NN) - Python
* I created a Multilayer Perceptron in Python as a class object to predict
whether an individual in 1994 earned $50,000 or more from Census data.
* I used functions in NumPy to define functions in a class that creates a 0,1, or
2-layer neural net from user input.
* Python was used with the Pandas and NumPy libraries, as well as the shuffle method from sklearn's utilities module.

### ["Using Logistic Regression to Build Credit Scores"](https://github.com/njones738/Using-Logistic-Regression-to-Build-Credit-Scores) - Python, SAS
* I created a model to predict a customer’s credit score by a binary predictor that
indicated whether a customer was considered a credit risk
* SAS procedures were used to conduct a logistic regression analysis to analysis
the profitability of models created in the process.
* In addition to SAS, I used Python to aid in deciding which parameters should have their missing values imputed and which should be dropped from the dataset.
