I am a graduate student at Kennesaw State Univerisity and will be graduating at the end of this year with my master's of Data Science and Analytics.   

Some of my interests include:
 * Deep Learning, Regression Analysis, Nonparametric Methods, Abstract Mathematics, Numerical Analysis, and Data Visualizations.  

The coding languages I currently use are Python, R, and SAS but I also know Java, HTML, and SQL.

## Previous Projects

### ["Mapping Post-Secondary Transfer Rates"](https://github.com/njones738/Mapping-Post-Secondary-Transfer-Rates) - Coded in R, Python
* Applied Graph Theory Learning Outcomes such as the clustering coefficient and network transitivity in Python
* Conducted research into the association between institutional transfer rates the number of schools within 100 miles of each other using the 2020-’21 CollegeScorecard dataset
* Used R to visualize findings with ggplot for use in presentation
* Awarded 3rd place Graduate Research Project at KSU’s 2023 Analytics Day

### ["Why Withdraw?"](https://github.com/njones738/Why-Withdraw) - Coded in R, Python, SAS
* Continued research into the CollegeScorecard with a longitudinal analysis
* Comments and Ratings left by reviewers were scraped from RateMyProfessor
* Conducted a sentiment analysis of the comments for use in the model

### ["Classification of Pell Institutions"](https://github.com/njones738/Classification-of-Pell-Institutions) - Coded in R, Python
* Continued in the pursuit of understanding the stewardship of low-income students by classifying Post-secondary institutions using a binary indicator created in “Access to Higher Education”
* Created several models and compared including XGBoost, PCA, Random Forest, and Logistical Regression
* Used R and Python to clean and structure the data to build models that classify Pell institutions
* Used the following packages: Tidyverse, magrittr, feather, and ggplot2 in R and sklearn, scipy, scikitplot, xgboost, category encoders, feather, matplotlib, plotnine, numpy and pandas

### ["Does the Pell grant come with a price?"](https://github.com/njones738/Does-the-Pell-grant-come-with-a-price-) - Coded in R, Python
* Continued my research into the CollegeScorecard with a spatial look at the institutions
* Spatially joined together the Census shapefiles with the CollegeScorecard dataset to analyze the association between debts accumulated by either an independent or dependent student
* Awarded 3rd place at KSU’s 2021 Analytics Day and selected to present at: Posters on the Hill 2022 (1 of 88 posters), Harvard National Collegiate Research Conference 2022, and Posters at the GA capitol 2022

### ["Access to Higher Education"](https://github.com/njones738/Access-to-Higher-Education) - Coded in R
* Conducted research on the CollegeScorecard dataset through parametric and nonparametric methods
* Studied the differences in US schools with either a majority or minority proportion of their student popluation receiving a Pell grant
* Used RStudio with tidyverse functions to clean the dataset of missing values and manipulate the data into usable information. Visualizations were created with ggplot methods

### ["Two-Layer Neural Network"](https://github.com/njones738/2L_NN) - Coded in Python
* Created a Multilayer Perceptron in Python as a class object to predict whether an individual in 1994 earned $50,000 or more from Census data
