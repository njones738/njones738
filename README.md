| [My resume can be found here.](Nathalie.jones.Resume.2024.pdf) |

Dedicated to harnessing the transformative power of mathematics and data science, I am passionately committed to leveraging innovative methods to develop solutions that support human users in the extraction of valuable information in large, complex data reservoirs

Some of my interests include:
 * Deep Learning, Statistical Theory, Abstract Mathematics, Analytical Storytelling, and Data Visualizations.  

The coding languages I currently use are Python, R, and SAS but I also know Java, HTML, and SQL.
